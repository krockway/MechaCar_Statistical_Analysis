## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
and write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:

![Linear Regression Results](https://github.com/krockway/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/Deliverable1.2.png)

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Ground clearance has a significant impact on a vehicle's MPG performance.

<!-- Intercept, wt, & hp are unlikely to provide random variance within the model (ie weight and horsepower have a significant impact on quarter-mile race time) -->

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

The total variance for all lots falls within the manufacturer's specifications of 100psi.

However, when broken down by lot, Lot 3 is an outlier and well over the manufacturer's specifications.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils, 
then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.
